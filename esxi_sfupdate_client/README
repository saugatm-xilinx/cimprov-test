For Windows build, toolchains built with http://mxe.cc/ were used, with
packages such as popt, libcurl, ncurses, etc installed. Now libraries
from there are placed in libs/windows/, so the program can be built with
Debian's mingw:

make PLATFORM=i686-pc-mingw32

For Linux build, simply use

make

32bit build in Linux 64bit environment was not tested successfully.

Inbuilt firmware images for BootROM and Controller firmware are taken
from folder specified by FIRMWARE_REPO environment variable.
