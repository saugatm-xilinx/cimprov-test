Libraries that we link statically to:

libcrypto.a, libssl.a: “The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an
Apache-style license, which basically means that you are free to get and
use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple
license conditions.”

libcurl.a: “Curl and libcurl are licensed under a MIT/X derivate license”

libssh2.a: http://www.libssh2.org/license.html

libz.a: http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html

All these libraries are included for curl functionality.

Also we link dynamically to such system libraries as libpthread, libc, 
libgcc_s, libm, and statically to libstdc++.a
